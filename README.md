# Text-Classification-Project
This is a NLP project for classifying a message as a spam or ham.

## Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a text classification model capable of distinguishing between spam and legitimate (ham) messages.

## Features:
* Spam Detection: The model is trained to identify spam messages based on their characteristics.
* Ham Classification: Legitimate messages are classified as ham by the model.
* Model Evaluation: The project includes evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the classification model.

## Implementation:
* Dataset: Utilizes a labeled dataset containing examples of spam and ham messages.
* Preprocessing: Text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming may be applied.
* Feature Engineering: Transforming text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning algorithms.
* Model Training: Training various machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or neural networks for classification.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
